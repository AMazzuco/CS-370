# CS-370
## Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
I was given the Python files GameExperience and TreasureMaze which I did not touch. I was given most of the code in the Jupyter notebook file and edited the cell to complete the Q-Training algortihm code block.
## Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
## What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientists design and develop software and hardware to help solve all sorts of problems that can range from simple to complex. It is important because we have grown to be fairly reliant on technology for a large variety of problems we face every day.
## How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
I approach problems as a computer scientist by first determining the problem and then trying to think of options that might solve it. I also need to consider what might be the best way to solve the problem with the tools I am using. From there I use my plan and execute it and test to see if it works. If it doesn't I go back and plan again, implement the change, and test again till it works.
## What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
My ethical responsibilities to the end user and organization are to try to make sure that I am not harming people or violating their privacy with my problem solving. It is also important to be aware of how bias can be accidentally introduced into our work if we are not focused on our entire audience.
